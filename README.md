# WebApps
A collection of web apps using java servlets.

1}HELLO SERVLET WEB APP:

This is a sample web app which just displays an HTML page having text "Hello Servlet!!!". In order to run this web app, just import this project into Eclipse indigo (for Java EE developers), set up a Tomcat Apache server and run this project on that server.

2}ServletExample:
This is a sample web app which is a slight advancement over the previous Hello Servlet web app. It uses Java Server Pages (JSP) to get user input and output the response.
